The provided C# code creates and manages a list of tasks using a linked list. A linked list is a way to store data where each item points to the next one, like a chain. Here’s a breakdown:

Node Class: This is like a single link in our chain. Each node stores a piece of data (like a task) and points to the next node in the list.

Data: The actual task or item.
Next: A reference to the next node in the list.
LinkedList Class: This manages the whole chain of nodes.

Head: The first node in the list.
Append: Adds a new task to the end of the list.
Prepend: Adds a new task to the beginning of the list.
Delete: Removes a task from the list by its value.
Display: Shows all tasks in the list.
Program Class: This is where we use the linked list to add, show, and delete tasks. Here’s what it does:

Main Method: The starting point of the program.
Adds tasks to the list.
Displays the tasks in the list.
Deletes a task and shows the updated list.
Task Management Example: The code shows how to manage tasks, like adding "Buy groceries" or "Complete homework" to the list and then marking tasks as done.

Example Scenario: Task Management
Imagine you have a list of things to do, and you can add new tasks, complete them, and see what's left. The program helps you do this:

Add Task: Adds new tasks to your list.
Complete Task: Marks tasks as done and removes them from the list.
Display Tasks: Shows all your tasks.
This way, you can keep track of what you need to do and what's already done, making it easier to manage your day. The linked list helps by letting you add or remove tasks quickly and easily.
